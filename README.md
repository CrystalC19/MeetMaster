# MeetMaster

## Overview
This project is a fantastic opportunity to showcase your collaborative skills and coding abilities, particularly in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN application. Employers will be interested in both your technical skills and your ability to work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the better your chances of securing an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements
With your group, you’ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies used throughout this course, including:

- Storing project code in GitHub
- Managing work with a project management tool
- Implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests

For this project, you should start from scratch to revisit your front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify your understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. Your group will use everything you’ve learned to create a MERN-stack single-page application that solves a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on your project, but it must fulfill the following requirements:

- **Use React for the front end**
- **Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server**
- **Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database**
- **Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data**
- **Be deployed using Render (with data)**
- **Have a polished UI**
- **Be responsive**
- **Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)**
- **Include authentication (JWT)**
- **Protect sensitive API key information on the server**
- **Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.)**
- **Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)**

### Additional Considerations
- **CSS Styling**: Consider using CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components, Emotion), a component library (e.g., Semantic UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design), or create all the CSS for your application from scratch.
- **Payment Platform**: Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform for accepting charitable donations or other payments.
- **Bonus**: Implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
  - Uses a web manifest
  - Uses a service worker for offline functionality
  - Is installable

## Presentation Requirements
Use the project presentation template to address the following:

1. **Elevator pitch**: A one-minute description of your application.
2. **Concept**: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
3. **Process**: What technologies were used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
4. **Demo**: Show your application in action.
5. **Directions for future development**.
6. **Links**: Provide links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

## Grading Requirements
This project is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 25%
- Application uses React for the front end.
- Application has a GraphQL API with a Node.js and Express.js server, and uses queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Application uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database and protects sensitive API key information on the server.
- Application includes user authentication using JWT.

### Concept: 10%
- Application should be a unique and novel idea.
- Your group should clearly and concisely articulate your project idea.

### Deployment: 20%
- Application deployed at live URL on Render and loads with no errors.
- Application GitHub URL submitted.

### Repository Quality: 10%
- Repository has a unique name.
- Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
- Repository follows best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
- Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
- Repository contains a high-quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

### Application Quality: 15%
- Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Application user interface style is clean and polished.
- Application is responsive.

### Presentation: 10%
- Your group should present using Google Slides, PowerPoint, or a similar presentation software.

- Your presentation should follow the Project Presentation Template.

### Collaboration: 10%
- There are no major disparities in the number of GitHub contributions between group members.

### Bonus
- Fulfilling all three of the following requirements to turn your app into a PWA will add 10 points to your grade (maximum grade is 100):
  - Uses a web manifest.
  - Uses a service worker for offline functionality.
  - Is installable.

## Submission
Each member of your group is required to submit the following for review:
- The URL of the deployed application.
- The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
